## Project Title: STARS ANALYSIS

For our 4th project we’ve decided to look at and analyse data relating to star’s. 

Firstly after deciding the members of our group and getting together we looked at  various data sets across various topic categories mainly used Kaggle & google searches to find our dataset.

We came to a general group consensus on our final dataset related to “star dataset for stellar classification” (star-categorization-giants-and-dwarfs). 

So this will be the problem/topic we wanted to analyse and visualise.

Next in our group we looked at deciding if we should do supervised or unsupervised machine learning at the moment we are leaning toward unsupervised 
machine learning. And we will also be using Scikit-learn as the main library to import well as other machine learning such as random forest possibly.

Also decided what of the following programming language we wanted to use such as panda’s, python matplotlib as well as Tableau to create a dashboard to 
showcase our data in a nice final visualisation.

## Dataset

[Kaggle Dataset - Star Dataset for Stellar Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinesmsuic/star-categorization-giants-and-dwarfs)  
[Stars Data - Raw](Resources/Star9999_raw.csv)   
[Stars Data - Clean](Resources/clean_stars.csv)  
[Stars Data - Final](Resources/final_stars.csv)

## Spectral Star Type

## Pre Processing

## Extract

Firstly, this process extracst the data from the CSV files using Pandas DataFrame. In the extraction phase, the unwanted columns were removed.

## Transformation

In the Transformation Phase, some columns were added to the DataFrame:

## Data Model Implementation

We have produced a Python script that initializes, trains, and evaluates a model based on our cleaned up dataset which is the `Final_Stars.csv`.

The cleaned, normalized, and standardized data was achieved as part of our pre-processing work at the begining of the project and prior to modeling. 
This is evidenced under the `resources` files starting with `Star9999_raw` then further formating within the `Clean_stars.csv` and lastly leading to our 
final `Final_Stars.csv` which is our fully formatted and cleaned dataset file.

The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)

The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)

## Data Model Optimization

The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself (15 points)

Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script (10 points)
